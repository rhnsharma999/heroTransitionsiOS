# heroTransitionsiOS
Sample app that makes use of the **[Hero Library](https://github.com/lkzhao/Hero)** in an iOS app.
Couldn't get it to work in the first and is also a little tough for beginners so thought of documenting it here.
Sample **magic move thingy** for UIViews implemented and also **how to use provided template transitions**.
